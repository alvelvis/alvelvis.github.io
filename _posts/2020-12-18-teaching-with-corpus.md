When I released my [English course for brazilians](/aprenda-ingles) I decided one of its biggest differentials would be the use of Corpus Linguistics resources, which is a practice that I have been employing in teaching for a while. Now I explain what that means.

A corpus is a collection of texts available in a digital format. Its content might be anything -- from newspaper articles, social network interactions, oral interviews, conversations or movies subtitles converted into a set of strings readable by machines. The resources that I have been developing are shaped in accordance to the students' interests -- whatever genres and subjects they value and need to learn the most -- and such *corpora* are processed with highly technological computational tools so that we are able to extract the best from a huge amount of data, easily gathering statistical and morphosyntactic patterns from it.

I see teaching as an activity in which professors create bridges between the students' goals and what they need to learn to accomplish them. There are, indeed, several common reasons why people want to learn a second language: to be able to read texts in that language, to travel to other countries and communicate with other people, to acquire knowledge from other cultures, to enhance their chances at getting a specific job and so on. All of them are daily real-life situations, and the great thing about teaching language is that what we should prepare our students for usually can be aligned with their own wishes, hobbies, and alike.

But learning a new language may not always be so intuitive and easy. It demands work, much reading, and almost as much writing. Language structure is not everything -- but it is highly important that, whenever a student seems distrustful of his own skills in a certain aspect of the language, we gather enough material to explore it with them and exercise it. A missed doubt is an unexplored valuable mine, and that is when corpus data comes in handy.

The idea is to subvert the vast majority of English teaching didactic material. While they create fake situations with imagined interactions to illustrate some new vocabulary or language structures, we present real-life language data. The student will learn the structures that they need to learn from reading fragments of newspaper articles and noticing how they are actually used on a daily basis. That way, the grammar discussions will inevitably lead to broader ones, about the context and the subjects behind the texts being studied. Nevertheless, the observation of specific language matters will not be skipped.

Also, another point that I want to make is that many second language courses will try to sell the idea that the best way to learn, or even the only way to learn a language, is by talking, through conversation. This is not true. One learns if he/she is focused on the subject, involved in its learning, and knows where to look for more data to study from without further guidance. If one thinks that only conversation can improve one's language skills, that person is going to be limited to specific class hours or to specific situations in which this person will find other people available to speak to. On the contrary, if this person knows where to find material on a topic of interest and learns how to solve their own doubts about language structure and vocabulary, this person has acquired the needed tools to learn in his/her own rhythm.

This method has been very successful in lifting my students' confidence in their own language skills because they see how much they have improved since day one by exercising their weak spots. We are not robots and do want to learn from building bridges to the actual world, and as well it is true that learning a difficult topic may require practice, repetition, hard work. Resources from Corpus Linguistics can fulfill both needs when applied correctly.
