When I released my [English course for brazilians](/aprenda-ingles) I thought one of its best differentials would be the use of Corpus Linguistics resources. Now I explain what that means.

A corpus is a collection of texts available in a digital format. Its content might be anything -- from newspaper articles, social network interactions, oral interviews, conversations or movies subtitles converted into a set of strings readable by machines. The resources that I have been developing are shaped in accordance to the students' personalities and such *corpora* are processed with highly technological computational tools so that we are able to extract the best from a huge amount of data, easily gathering statistical and morphosyntactic patterns from it.

I see teaching as an activity in which professors create bridges between the students' wishes and what they need to learn to accomplish them. There are, indeed, several common reasons why people want to learn a second language: to be able to read material in that language, to travel to other countries and communicate with other people, to acquire knowledge from other cultures, to enhance their chances at getting a specific job, etc. All of them are daily real-life situations, and the great thing about teaching language is that what we should prepare our students for usually can be aligned with their own wishes, hobbies and alike.

But learning a new language may not always be so intuitive and easy. It demands work, much reading and almost as much writing. Language structure is not everything -- but it is highly important that, whenever a student seems distrustful of his own skills in a certain aspect of the language, we gather enough material to explore it with them and exercise it. A missed doubt is an unexplored valuable mine, and that is when corpus data comes in handy.

The idea is to subvert the vast majority of English teaching didactic material. While they create fake situations with imagined interactions to illustrate some new vocabulary or language structures, we present real-life language data. The student will learn the structures that they need to learn from reading fragments of newspaper articles and noticing how they are actually used on a daily basis. That way, the grammar discussions will inevitably lead to broader ones, about the context and the subjects behind the texts being studied. Nevertheless, the observation of specific language matters will not be skipped.

This method has been very successful in lifting my students confidence on their own language skills because they see how much they have improved since day one by exercising their weak spots. We are not robots and do want to learn from building bridges to the actual world, and as well it is true that learning a difficult topic may require practice, repetition, hard work. Resources from Corpus Linguistics can fulfill both needs when applied correctly.
